"Let's break down the situation and analyze it from different perspectives:

1. **Your Perspective (13f)**:
   - You were excited and nervous about your debate finals.
   - You provided necessary information to your parents about the event.
   - You felt hurt and disappointed when your father didn't show up.
   - You believe your messages were clear and not rude.

2. **Your Father's Perspective (65m)**:
   - He felt your messages were rude or abrupt.
   - He might have been confused about the location and timing.
   - He decided not to attend based on his interpretation of your messages.
   - He later showed up at the award ceremony, possibly feeling guilty or wanting to support you.

3. **Communication**:
   - Your messages were concise and to the point, which might come off as abrupt, especially if your father is not used to such direct communication.
   - The lack of a more personal touch or explicit appreciation in your messages might have contributed to his feeling that they were rude.

4. **Expectations and Emotions**:
   - Both you and your father had high emotions and expectations for the event.
   - Miscommunication and misunderstanding can easily happen in such situations.

5. **Outcome**:
   - Your father not showing up initially hurt you, and his later appearance at the award ceremony caused further emotional distress.
   - The situation could have been handled better by both parties.

Considering all these points, it's clear that there was a miscommunication and misunderstanding between you and your father. While your messages could have been perceived as abrupt, your father's decision to not attend without further clarification was also not ideal. Both parties share some responsibility in this situation.

Given the context and the age difference, it's understandable that you might not have fully grasped how your messages could be interpreted. However, your father's reaction was also disproportionate to the situation.

Overall, I would rate this situation as a [[6]]. You are more in the right because you were trying to communicate important information under stress, but there is room for improvement in how you communicate with your parents to avoid such misunderstandings in the future.","Let's break down the situation:

1. **Context and Background**: You are a 13-year-old who has been involved in debating for a couple of years. This was your first time making it to the finals, which is a significant achievement. Your parents are divorced, and this was the first time either of them would attend one of your debates.

2. **Communication**: You sent a series of messages to your parents to inform them about the event's details. The messages were concise and to the point, but your father found them rude.

3. **Father's Reaction**: Your father decided not to attend based on the tone of your messages. He later claimed that you provided incorrect information about the building location.

4. **Aftermath**: You were hurt by your father's decision not to attend and expressed this to him. He emphasized the importance of acting right if you want others to show up for you. He did show up for the award ceremony, but the situation had already caused emotional distress.

5. **Reflection**: You recognize that you might be partially at fault and are seeking an outside perspective.

### Analysis:

- **Your Perspective**: You were excited and wanted to share your achievement with your parents. You provided necessary information but perhaps in a hurried or stressed manner, which might have come off as curt.
  
- **Father's Perspective**: He felt disrespected by the tone of your messages and decided not to attend as a consequence. He also felt misinformed about the location.

### Considerations:

- **Age and Stress**: At 13, it's understandable that you might not always communicate perfectly, especially under stress. Your excitement and nervousness could have influenced the tone of your messages.
  
- **Parental Support**: Parents should ideally be more understanding of their children's communication, especially in high-stress situations. Your father could have communicated his concerns about the tone in a more supportive manner rather than deciding not to attend.

- **Communication Breakdown**: There was a clear breakdown in communication. Your father could have clarified the location issue or expressed his feelings about the tone before deciding not to attend.

### Conclusion:

While your messages might have been perceived as curt, your father's reaction seems disproportionate given the context of your achievement and age. Both parties could have handled the situation better, but the primary responsibility for supporting a child in such moments lies with the parent.

### Final Score:

Considering all factors, I would rate your position as a [[7]]. You were not entirely in the right due to the tone of your messages, but your father's reaction was overly harsh and not supportive given the circumstances.","Let's break down the situation:

1. **Context and Background**: You are a 13-year-old who has been involved in debating for a couple of years. This was your first time making it to the finals, which is a significant achievement. Your parents are divorced, and this was the first time either of them would attend one of your debates.

2. **Communication**: You sent a series of messages to your parents to inform them about the event's details. The messages were concise and to the point, but your father found them rude, particularly the last one: ""Im putting my phone away now so don't bother messaging me.""

3. **Father's Reaction**: Your father decided not to attend the debate based on the tone of your messages. He later claimed he didn't know where the event was and criticized you for not providing the correct information.

4. **Aftermath**: You were hurt by your father's absence and expressed this to him. He responded by emphasizing the importance of ""acting right"" if you want others to show up for you. He did attend the award ceremony but arrived late, which caused you emotional distress.

5. **Reflection**: You recognize that you might be partially at fault and are seeking an external perspective.

### Analysis:

- **Your Perspective**: You were excited and nervous about the debate and wanted to ensure your parents had the necessary information. The message about putting your phone away was likely meant to set boundaries so you could focus, not to be rude.

- **Father's Perspective**: He interpreted your messages as rude and decided not to attend, possibly feeling disrespected. His decision to not inform you of his change in plans added to the emotional strain.

- **Communication Breakdown**: The primary issue seems to be a misunderstanding and a lack of clear communication. Your father could have communicated his feelings about the messages before deciding not to attend. Similarly, you could have phrased your messages more considerately.

### Judgment:

- **Your Actions**: You were trying to manage your stress and communicate necessary information. While the tone of your messages could be seen as curt, it wasn't intentionally disrespectful.

- **Father's Actions**: His decision to not attend based on the perceived rudeness of your messages seems disproportionate, especially given the significance of the event for you. Additionally, not informing you of his decision added to your distress.

Given the context and the actions of both parties, I would rate your position as follows:

[[7]]

This score reflects that while your messages could have been more considerate, your father's reaction was overly harsh and not well-communicated. Both parties have room for improvement in communication, but your father's actions had a more significant negative impact on the situation.","Let's break down the situation:

1. **Context and Background**:
   - The poster (13f) has been involved in debating for a couple of years and has finally made it to the finals.
   - Both parents are supportive but have never attended her debates due to her preference.
   - This time, both parents wanted to attend, but due to scheduling conflicts, the father (65m) was the one who ended up planning to go.

2. **Communication**:
   - The poster sent a series of messages to her parents to keep them updated on the day of the event.
   - The messages were straightforward and informative, though the last message (""Im putting my phone away now so don't bother messaging me"") could be perceived as curt.

3. **Father's Reaction**:
   - The father found the messages rude and decided not to attend the debate.
   - He did not inform the poster of his decision until after the debate had concluded.
   - He later attended the award ceremony, which led to an emotional reaction from the poster.

4. **Post-Debate Interaction**:
   - The poster expressed her hurt to her father, who responded by emphasizing the importance of respectful communication.
   - The father insisted that the poster had given incorrect information about the building location.

5. **Emotional Impact**:
   - The poster was clearly hurt by her father's absence and the subsequent interaction.
   - The situation led to a strained relationship between the poster and her father.

**Analysis**:
- The poster's messages, while perhaps a bit blunt, were not overtly disrespectful. Given her age and the context of preparing for an important event, her focus and brevity are understandable.
- The father's decision to not attend based on the perceived rudeness of the messages seems disproportionate, especially considering the significance of the event for the poster.
- The lack of communication from the father about his decision not to attend added to the poster's distress.
- The father's later attendance at the award ceremony, while well-intentioned, did not mitigate the initial hurt caused by his absence.

**Conclusion**:
- The poster's actions were not perfect, but they were understandable given her age and the context.
- The father's reaction and lack of communication were more problematic and contributed significantly to the emotional fallout.

Given these considerations, I would rate the poster's position as a [[7]]. She is mostly in the right, with some room for improvement in communication, but the father's actions were more at fault in this situation.","To evaluate the situation, let's break down the key points:

1. **Background**: The poster (13f) has been involved in debating for a couple of years and finally made it to the finals. Both parents are supportive but have never attended her debates due to her preference.

2. **Parental Decision**: The parents, who are divorced, were deciding who should attend. The mother had an event, so the father decided to go.

3. **Communication**: On the day of the event, the poster sent several messages to her parents to keep them informed. The messages were:
   - ""There's a bunch of house signs where we're walking""
   - ""Our debate is in the (name) building""
   - ""7:-7:15 for award ceremony""
   - ""You can find our room by a sheet on the window""
   - ""I'm putting my phone away now so don't bother messaging me""

4. **Father's Reaction**: The father found the messages rude and decided not to attend. He informed her of this decision after she had already gone into training.

5. **Aftermath**: The poster was hurt by her father's absence, especially since he didn't communicate his decision earlier. The father later attended the award ceremony, causing the poster to cry in one of the photos. They haven't spoken since.

**Analysis**:
- **Poster’s Perspective**: She was excited and wanted her parents to be there. Her messages, while direct, were not overtly rude. She was focused on the event and likely stressed.
- **Father’s Perspective**: He felt disrespected by the tone of the messages and decided not to attend as a consequence. However, he did not communicate this decision in a timely manner, which added to the poster's distress.

**Judgment**:
- The poster could have been more considerate in her communication, but her messages were not explicitly rude.
- The father overreacted by not attending and failing to inform her promptly, which was more hurtful given the significance of the event.

Given these points, the poster is not entirely blameless but is more in the right compared to the father. The father's reaction was disproportionate and poorly timed.

Final score: [[7]]","Let's break down the situation:

1. **Context and Background**: The poster is a 13-year-old girl who has been involved in debating for a couple of years. This was her first time making it to the finals, which is a significant achievement for her. Her parents are divorced, and this adds a layer of complexity to the situation.

2. **Communication**: The poster sent a series of messages to her parents to inform them about the event's details. The messages were straightforward and factual, but the last message (""Im putting my phone away now so don't bother messaging me"") could be perceived as curt or dismissive.

3. **Father's Reaction**: The father interpreted the messages, particularly the last one, as rude and decided not to attend the debate. This decision was made without further communication or clarification, which could be seen as an overreaction given the importance of the event to his daughter.

4. **Outcome and Aftermath**: The father did not attend the debate but showed up at the award ceremony, which led to an emotional reaction from the poster. The lack of communication and the father's decision not to attend without informing his daughter beforehand contributed to her distress.

5. **Responsibility and Fault**: The poster acknowledges that she might be partially at fault for the tone of her messages. However, the father's decision to not attend based on a perceived slight, without considering the significance of the event for his daughter, seems disproportionate.

6. **Emotional Impact**: The poster was clearly hurt by her father's absence and the subsequent events. The father's insistence on teaching a lesson about ""acting right"" during such an important moment for his daughter seems insensitive.

Considering all these points, the poster's actions might have been slightly brusque, but the father's reaction was disproportionate and lacked empathy. The father should have communicated his feelings about the messages rather than deciding not to attend an important event for his daughter.

"I just wrote this post to reddit, and I really think I am in the right here. Can you please judge my post from 1-10, where 1 is that I am clearly in the wrong and 10 is that I am clearly in the right?I (13f) have been doing debating since I was 11 and have always been very proactive in it with both of my parents supporting me.

Can you please judge the post from 1-10, where 1 is that they are clearly in the wrong and 10 is that they are clearly in the right?I (13f) have been doing debating since I was 11 and have always been very proactive in it with both of my parents supporting me. This was my first time making it to the finals after repeatedly making it to semi's, and I was really excited to be going.

My parents are divorced and my mother (55f) and my father (65m) were decided ing who should go since they had never come to my debates before (not their fault I usually ask them not to since it stresses me out). They were deciding who should go to watch me and my mother who was insistent on going ended up having an event on so my father said he would.

We only really got information on the day for the timing so during the day I was sending messages to my parents letting them know what was happening. Right when I was going into training before prep I sent my final messages which my dad said were rude so he decided not to go. (The slashes mean a new message and for reference my brother went to school which was hosting so my parents knew a bit about the school.)

""There's a bunch of house signs where we're walking/Our debate is in the (name) building/7:-7:15 for award ceremony/You can find our room by a sheet on the window/Im putting my phone away now so don't bother messaging me""

From what I saw after the debate had finished 20 minutes later my father had replied saying he wasn't going. I texted him telling him the result (we won!) which he immediately responded to and called him some time later telling him how I was hurt that he didn't show up and that if he was rethinking going I would've appreciated if he could've told me. He told me if I want others to show up for me I need to act right and insistently told me that I told him the wrong building since he didn't know where it was.
